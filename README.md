# Machine learning model that predicts which employee is most at risk of having an accident at work

A company is concerned about potential risks to its employees due to work accidents that occurred in its production process. In this context, it decides to adopt an action plan whose main objective is to reduce the risk of accidents in its plants. As a first step, it decides to conduct an analysis to investigate the main factors that may contribute to the occurrence of this event.

### Libraries used:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- sklearn

python: 3.10.4

I tested 3 machine learning models: 
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

### With some data manipulation and hyperparameter tunning i get this results

<br><strong>Logistic</strong>:</br> 

precision_78%  
F1________84%  
accuracy__74%  
AUC______66%

<br><strong>Decision Tree</strong>:</br>
